# Angular Practices

--

This repository is dedicated to enhance and explore my skill in Angular. I want to know more about Angular even though in meantime I'm still doubting myself whether I will learn it deeply about Angular, hence there will be some useless projects in this repository, but it's okay anyway.

Have a nice practice!
